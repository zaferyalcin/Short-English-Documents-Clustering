# Short-English-Documents-Clustering
In this project, short document clustering algorithms for the English language were compared.

# Dataset
The dataset we will use for the English dataset will be the BBC dataset. BBC Dataset
is a news article dataset originating from BBC news provided for use as benchmarks for
machine learning research. The BBC data set contains texts in 5 categories which are
categories sports, politics, business, tech and entertainment. It consists of 2225 articles in
